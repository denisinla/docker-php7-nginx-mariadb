### LEMP Setup
_this assumes that you've setup your docker-machine and have docker-compose installed_

1. Adjust your .env file
2. Run ```docker-compose up```
3. Run ```docker-machine ip <machine name>``` (This will give you the running docker-machine IP to access the containers)
4. Open your browser to the IP address docker-machine returned.
